BlonDe and BWB are developed for document-level machine translation.
BlonDe is an automatic evaluation metric that explicitly tracks discourse phenomena.
BWB is a large-scale bilingual parallel corpus that consists of web novels.

We hope that they will serve as a guide and inspiration for more work in the area of document level machine translation.

## üìê The BlonDe Package:

### Package Overview

<img align="right" width="300" src="image/blonde_motivation.png">

Standard automatic metrics, e.g. BLEU, are not reliable for document-level MT evaluation. They can neither distinguish document-level improvements in translation quality from sentence-level ones, nor identify the discourse phenomena that cause context-agnostic translations.

BlonDe is proposed to widen the scope of automatic MT evaluation from sentence to the document level. It takes discourse coherence into consideration by categorizing discourse-related spans and calculating the similarity-based F1 measure of categorized spans. 

As shown in the figure, BlonDe is a lot more selective than BLEU for document-level MT 
and shows a larger quality difference between human and machine translations.

In the BlonDe package, there are:
- ``BlonDe``: the main metric, combining ``dBlonDe`` with sentence-level measurement
- ``dBlonDe``: measures the discourse phonomena (``entity``, ``tense``, ``pronoun``, ``discourse markers``)
- ``BlonDe+``: takes human annotation (annotated ambiguous/ommitted phrases and manually-annotated NER) into consideration


### ‚è≥ Installation
**Python>=3.6 only**

Before you install ``blonde``, make sure that
your `pip`, `setuptools`Ôºå`wheel` and `spacy` are up to date, and ``en_core_web_sm`` is downloaded.
```sh
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -U spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Install the official Python module from PyPI:
```sh
pip install blonde
```
Install the latest unstable version from the master branch on Github:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/EleanorJiang/BlonDe
```

Install from the source:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/EleanorJiang/BlonDe
cd BlonDe
pip install .
```
and you may test your installation by:
```
python -m unittest discover
```

### Usage
We provide a command line interface (CLI) of BlonDe as well as a python 
module. 
We provide example inputs under `./example`.

### Command-line Usage
You can use it as follows for the simplest usage:
```sh
blonde -r example/ref.txt -s sys.txt
```

To use human-annotated spans for `BlonDe+`, 
add `-p` and provide the annotation file path with `-an`, as in:
```sh
blonde -r example/ref.txt -s sys.txt -p -an example/an.txt
```

To use human-annotated named entities (instead of automatic detected ones), 
add `-p` and provide the named entity file path with `-ner`, as in:
```sh
blonde -r example/ref.txt -s sys.txt -p -ner example/ner.txt
```

### Using BlonDe from Python
Following [SacreBLEU](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu), we also recommend users to use the object-oriented API, by creating an instance of the `BLONDE` class.
A detailed example is provided in ``example.py``.

#### Loading Package and creating an ``BLONDE`` object:
 ```python
from blonde import BLONDE
blonde = BLONDE()
```
#### For a single document:
 ```python
score = blonde.corpus_score([sys_doc], [[ref_doc_1], [ref_doc_2], ...])
   ```
where  ``sys_doc``, ``ref_doc_1`` and ``ref_doc_2`` are  ``List[str]``.

#### For a corpus:
```python
score = blonde.corpus_score(sys_corpus, [ref_corpus_1, ref_corpus_2, ...])
```
where ``sys_corpus``, ``ref_corpus_1`` and ``ref_corpus_2`` are ``List[List[str]]``.

#### For multiple systems & statistical testing:
 ```python
blonde = BLONDE(references=[ref_corpus]) # for faster recomputation
score = blonde.corpus_score(sys_corpus)
```

#### BlonDe+:
 ```python
blonde_plus = BLONDE(references=[ref_corpus],
                     annotation=an_corpus,
                     ner_refined=ner_corpus
                 )
score = blonde_plus.corpus_score(sys_corpus)
  ```

#### Adjust parameters:
 ```python
BLONDE(weights: Weight=WEIGHTS_DEFAULTS,
       weight_normalize: bool = False,
       average_method: str = 'geometric',
       categories: dict = CATEGORIES,
       plus_categories=None,  # ("ambiguity", "ellipsis")
       plus_weights=(1, 1),
       lowercase: bool = False,
       smooth_method: str = 'exp',
       smooth_value: Optional[float] = None,
       effective_order: bool = False,
       references: Optional[Sequence[Sequence[Sequence[str]]]] = None,
       annotation: Sequence[Sequence[str]] = None,
       ner_refined: Sequence[Sequence[str]] = None)
```
| Parameter | Description !
|-----------|-------------|
| categories | A dict where the keys are chosen from `('tense', 'pronoun', 'entity', 'n-gram')`, and the keys are the names of features in different categories, Dict[str, Sequence[str]]. If `None`, `('tense', 'pronoun', 'entity', 'n-gram')` are included.
| weights | The weights of the aerformentioned features, Dict[str, Sequence[float]]. If `None`, uniform weights are adopted. 
| plus_categories | The human annotated categories, e.g. `('ambiguity', 'ellipsis')` (default: `None`)
| plus_weights | The weights of the human annotated categories (default: `None`)
| weight_normalize | Whether to reweight to 1 (default: `False`)
| lowercase | If `True`, lowercased BLONDE is computed.
| average_method| The average method to use. Choose from `('geometric', 'arithmetic')`.
| smooth_method| The smoothing method to use. Choose from `('floor', 'add-k', 'exp' or 'none')`.
| smooth_value | The smoothing value for `floor` and `add-k` methods. `None` falls back to default value.
| max_ngram_order| If given, it overrides the maximum n-gram order (default: `4`).
| effective_order| If `True`, stop including n-gram orders for which score is 0. This should be `True`, if sentence-level BLONDE will be computed.
| references| A sequence of reference documents with document being defined as a sequence of reference strings. If given, the reference n-grams and lengths will be pre-computed and cached for faster BLONDE computation across many systems.

## üìô The BWB Dataset:

### Dataset Overview
![<img align="right" width="400">](image/bwb_dataset_stats.jpg)
The BWB dataset is a large-scale document-level Chinese--English parallel dataset.
It consists of Chinese online novels across multiple genres (sci-fi, romance, action, fantasy, comedy, etc.) 
and their corresponding English translations crawled from the Internet.
The novels are translated by professional native English speakers, and are corrected by editors.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest document-level translation dataset to date. 

#### The Statistics of BWB:

|      |   Train   |  Test  |  Dev  |  Total  |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| #Docs     | 196,304        | 80      | 79      | 196K   |
| #Sents       | 9,576,566    | 2,632     | 2,618      | 9.58M     |
| #Words      | 325.4M        | 68.0K      | 67.4K     | 460.8M      |

**Note:**

- Each **document** is a chapter. 
- The source document and the target document are aligned at the **sentence**-level.
- To prevent any train-test leakage, we split the dataset into a training, development and a test set such that chapters from the same book are part of the same split. 


### Annotation Format
The test set of BWB is annotated.
For each document, there are:
- ``chs_re.txt``: the original Chinese document. Each line is a sentence.
- ``ref_re.txt``: the reference English document. Each line is a sentence.
- ``ner_re.txt``: the named entities that appear in each sentence and their counts in the sentence.
- ``an.txt``: the error type, along with the spans that may cause ``ambiguity`` or ``ellipsis``.

**Error Types:**

|  Error Type    |   #id   |  Description  |  With Span Annotation  |  
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| ``ambiguity``     | 1       | There is(are) some ambiguous term(s) that is(are) correct in the stand-alone sentence but wrong in context.       |:heavy_check_mark:      |
| ``ellipsis-pronoun``     | 2    | There is(are) error(s) caused by the omission of pronouns.     | :heavy_check_mark:       | 
| ``ellipsis-other``     | 3       | There is(are) error(s) caused by the omission of other phrases.      | :heavy_check_mark:     | 
| ``named entity``      | 4       | There is(are) error(s) due to the mistranslation of named entities.    |    | 
| ``tense``      | 5       | There is(are) error(s) due to tense.     |    | 
| ``sentence-level``| 6 | There is(are) sentence-level error(s). |    | 


For better reproducing our results, we also provide:
- ``mt_re.txt``: the MT output we use in discourse error analysis. Each line is a sentence.
- ``pe_re.txt``: the human post-editing on provided the MT output by professional translators.

Qiao Lian clenched her fists and lowered her head.
Actually, he was right.
She was indeed an idiot, as only an idiot would believe that they could find true love online.
She curled her lips and took a deep breath. Just when she was about to put down her cell phone, a barrage of posts bombarded her WeChat account.
She logged into her account and saw that a large number of fans in the Shen Liangchuan fan group had tagged her.
[Qiao Lian: What happened?]
[Chuan Forever: Qiao Lian, look at the headlines on Weibo, quickly!]
She froze momentarily, then picked up her cell phone and logged into Weibo. When she saw the headlines, her entire body immediately froze over again!
Shen Liangchuan arrived at the scene after accepting the invitation. The director immediately went to greet him in a respectful manner, politely welcoming him and expressing his gratitude for Shen Liangchuan‚Äôs presence today.
Shen Liangchuan did not speak. Instead he looked at Wang Wenhao, who was nearby.
After Wang Wenhao‚Äôs scandal broke, every film he starred in had been taken down. Only this show could still be broadcasted, as Wang Wenhao had a supporting role in it and was practically unnoticeable.
In fact, the cast and crew hadn‚Äôt even invited Wang Wenhao. However, he had obtained a copy of the invitation letter somehow, and strode imposingly into the venue anyway.
After all, this was his final chance.
After his scandals broke, practically every advertiser and filming crew wanted to break their contracts with him.
He would rather take a supporting role than fade out into obscurity.
That was because the scandals surrounding him would never disappear.
Thus, Wang Wenhao went around trying to curry favor with everybody at this press conference.
Shen Liangchuan was wearing a dark grey suit and he had a cold expression. He was holding a champagne glass and was currently standing beside a table. He looked exceptionally stylish, but also exceptionally icy. As a result, none of the people around him dared to approach him.
If anyone had paid attention to him, they would have noticed that his gaze kept drifting over to Wang Wenhao.
Song Cheng stood at his side. After noticing his behavior, he could not help but pinch his arm.
Shen Liangchuan turned around and looked at him casually, with a questioning face.
‚ÄúBrother Shen, what are you planning to do? Can you tell me beforehand so that I can prepare myself mentally. You suddenly decide to come and attend such a small-scale press conference, yet you have been completely silent and are now just standing here and doing nothing? My heart is beating anxiously right now.‚Äù
After Shen Liangchuan heard him speak, he sipped a mouthful of champagne and put the glass down.
Then, he walked away in long strides.
Song Cheng was extremely nervous and followed him. Shen Liangchuan walked forward, one step at a time, until he reached the front of the room.
Wang Wenhao was currently ingratiating himself with a C-list celebrity. The celebrity asked, ‚ÄúHey, I heard that you beat a paparazzi?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, the paparazzi nowadays are so disgusting. I have wanted to teach them a lesson myself for some time now!‚Äù "Are not you afraid of becoming an enemy of them?"
‚ÄúI‚Äôve already done it, so what should I be scared of? That time Best Actor Shen beat up a reporter, he claimed that it was in self-defence so that he would have an excuse if he got sued, right? At that time, nobody said anything‚Äù 
As Wang Wenhao spoke, he laughed heartily. Just as he was about to continue speaking, he suddenly felt a presence approaching him from behind.
He turned around and saw Shen Liangchuan. His eyes narrowed and attempted to smile at him. However, Shen Liangchuan took a step forward, grabbed his tie and threw a punch at his face!
